    text: "Tight hips from sitting all day? Try stretching every hour for 2–3 minutes. The hip flexor stretch—kneeling with one leg forward and pushing your hips gently forward—can unlock that stiffness fast."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "Neck pain? Keep your monitor at eye level to maintain proper posture. Bonus: Add a 30‑second chin tuck (pull your chin back like you’re making a double chin) to reset your neck alignment."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "Wrist discomfort? Try wrist circles and stretches between typing sessions. For a deeper fix, press your palms together at chest height and lower them slowly to stretch your forearms."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    text: "Lower back pain? Strengthen your core with simple exercises like planks—hold for 20–30 seconds to start. A strong core acts like a natural brace for your spine."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    text: "Eye strain driving you nuts? Follow the 20‑20‑20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It’s a game‑changer for screen fatigue."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    text: "Shoulders tight from hunching? Roll them back 10 times, then try a doorway stretch—arms at 90 degrees, lean forward. It’s like hitting the reset button on your upper body."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    text: "Feeling like a rusty robot? Dynamic stretches like leg swings (10 per leg) or arm circles (20 seconds) boost mobility and get your blood flowing."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    text: "Slouching all day? Stand against a wall, arms raised, and slide them up and down like a snow angel. This ‘wall angel’ move strengthens your posture muscles."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    text: "Stiff from head to toe? Set a timer to move every 45 minutes—walk, stretch, or even dance for 2 minutes. Small bursts of movement beat stiffness every time."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    text: "Want a pro‑level tip? Use a lacrosse ball to roll out tight spots (like your glutes or upper back) against a wall. It’s self‑massage that digs deep into pain points."
  },

  {
    id: 11,
    text: "Hydration hack: Dehydrated muscles feel tighter. Sip water throughout the day and you’ll notice your stretches feel smoother and more ‘elastic.’"
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    text: "Stretching is awesome, but it won’t magically fix a chronic injury or severe pain. If a movement consistently hurts, pause the stretch and chat with a healthcare pro."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    text: "Pair every stretch with a strengthening move. For example, follow a hamstring stretch with a set of glute bridges. Flexibility + strength = bullet‑proof joints."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    text: "Deep‑breathing bonus: Inhale before the stretch, then exhale slowly as you ease deeper. Your muscles relax more when your nervous system is calm."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    text: "Cool‑down trick: Finish long work sessions with a 2‑minute ‘movement flow’—think cat‑cow, forward fold, and shoulder rolls. It resets your body and your brain."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    text: "Set a recurring reminder (phone, watch, or desktop app) every hour. Micro‑breaks beat marathon sitting marathons—your back will thank you."
